Mac OS X todo:
 - use native help system: http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000072.php
 - use native spellchecking - done automaticall,y but set the right
    language (NSSpellChecker)
 - use 32x32 icons (kHIToolbarDisplaySizeDefault)
 - detect UI language correctly (wx fix?)
 - make it runnable "in tray", don't exit if last file closed
 - native help viewer(?)
   1. It doesn't seem to like other charsets than UTF-8 (which is fine, all  
   our message catalogs are in that format anyway)

   2. Probably a wx bug, but: if you have the file selection dialog open in a  
   folder, and switch to the Finder and remove one of the files in the  
   directory that Poedit is currently displaying, it crashes.



XLIFF support

High priority:

- save catalog manager content to a file, so that it can be put into
  CVS for some project

- inserting %s, %d, <html_tags> into translation with a shortcut 

- make list control customizable: optionally display only "original string"
  column (suggested by Mladen Mintakovic)

- sortable list (by columns) both in catalog manager and the main frame

- use virtual wxListCtrl
- remember the exact way msgid/msgstr was stored (where the boundaries between 
  multiple lines are) and save it like that unless modified.

- TMX import/export: http://www.opentag.com/tmx.htm

- loading of .mo files

- make it possible to edit (or at least export & import) translation memory.
  Reason: there may be wrong translations in it.

Lower priority:

- (??) Some means of automatically submitting updated translations: either via
       a web or xml-rpc application or by directly accessing CVS...

- automatic translation via web services     [Vadim]
  (Babelfish and Perl/Python script to parse it; maybe Google SOAP)

- statistics (# of words, # of characters)
- TM should split input string into sentences before querying db
- OnResize should move the sash so that its distance from bottom edge stays same
- shared databases for multiple users?
- reading MO files directly
- configurable file extension of .mo file (.gmo)
- when saving po files, write more references on one line
- It should be possible to sort for original and tranlation strings on the main
  window. This would make it easier to find similar translations, to see them
  immediately.
- Search for comment could help to find some strings faster.
